From <http://www.seleniumhq.org/>: "Selenium automates browsers. That's it!
What you do with that power is entirely up to you. Primarily, it is for
automating web applications for testing purposes, but is certainly not
limited to just that. Boring web-based administration tasks can (and
should!) also be automated as well."
