### Upcoming Features
 - Make the tool universal as opposed to focused. Use case: "New company is oboarding a new hire. They tell the new hire they can use this tool if they are confused about anything. *The tool is configured to host curated information about the tools the company uses and why they use them*"
 - Focus more on markdown generation. The idea is that by simply creating these text files, with custom sections specified, an intricate website is automatically spun up from the repo.
 - Make the sections universal, specified by a string, such as % or something.
 - Make the files separated into categories by differentiating between folders. Hierarchy would be INFO -> Tools / Bios / Tutorials, and then Tools/Bios/Tutorials would hold .TBD files that are scraped. Then, the folders Tools/Bios/Tutorials would be categories in the website and also the CLI.
